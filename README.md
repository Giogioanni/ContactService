# CS320 Software Testing, Automation

**_How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?_**

Ensuring my code, program, or software is function and secur involves implementing thorough testing and follow best standards/practices set for security. I use unit tests to validate individual components of software, making sure they work in isolation. For instance in the Contact service project located in this repository I wrote comprehensive unit tests in 'ContactTest' and 'ContactServiceTest' to verify that each method i performed was running as expected and handled edge cases properly. Additionally, adopting secure coding practices, like input validation or proper authetication enhances security immensely. Regularly updating the dependencies and applying security pathces when and if needed play a key point in maintaining a softwares security as well. 

**_How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?_**

Interpreting and implementing user needs involves gathering requirements from them (stakeholders) directly and translating these needs into functional specifications. Prioritizing understanding the user's goals and pain points to create the software effectively as i can is a decicing point in information gathering. In this contact service project I identified and added the essential functionalities required to add, update, and delete contact information. I then incorporated these functionalities into 'Contact' and 'ContactService' classes which ensured i met the specified reqiurements. User feedback and iterative development also play critical roles in determining and implementing user needs.

**_How do I approach designing software?_**

I approach desgining software like if im building a house, setting up 4 walls and a roof and flooring. Gathering the materials, laying out what design i want the house to be. Using OOP to create modular and reusable components like setting up drywall. After the construction is done, making the finishing touches like painting or doing landscaping is like conducting testing optimizing user interface and performance. Updating and maintaining the house, same as adding new features to a software to fix bugs and improve performance. All in all ensuring that each class in my project had a single responsibility and follows SOLID principles to enhance the scalability and maintainability was decisive.
